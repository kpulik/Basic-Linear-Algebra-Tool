# Matrix Operations Program

This Python program allows users to perform various operations on a matrix including calculating the rank, determinant, inverse, eigenvalues, nullity, multiplicity, and checking for linear independence.

### Features:

- Users can input the dimensions of the matrix and populate it with user-defined elements.
- The program provides functionalities to calculate the rank, determinant, inverse, eigenvalues, nullity, multiplicity, and check for linear independence of the matrix.
- Users can choose to perform a specific operation or select 'all' to execute all operations in one go.

### How to Use:

1. Run the program in a Python environment.
2. Input the number of rows and columns for the matrix.
3. Populate the matrix with elements.
4. Choose the operation you want to perform ('rank', 'det', 'inv', 'eig', 'null', 'mult', 'lindep', 'all', or 'exit').
5. View the results and repeat steps 4-5 for different operations.

Enjoy exploring the program's functionalities for matrix manipulation and analysis!
