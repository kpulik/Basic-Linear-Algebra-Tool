# Matrix Operations Program

This program allows you to perform various matrix operations in Python, including calculating the rank, determinant, inverse, eigenvalues, nullity, multiplicity, and checking for linear independence.

### Features:

- **Input Matrix:** Define the dimensions of the matrix and input matrix elements.
- **Matrix Operations:** Compute individual matrix operations such as:

  - rank
  - determinant
  - inverse
  - eigenvectors and eigenvalues
  - nullity
  - multiplicity
  - checking for linear independence
  - addition
  - subtracion
  - multiplication
  - division
  - diagonalization.
- **How to Use:**

1. **Run the Program:** Start the program in a Python environment.
2. **Matrix Dimensions:** Set the number of rows and columns for the matrix.
3. **Matrix Elements:** Fill the matrix with desired elements.
4. **Select Operation:** Choose the operation you want to perform ('rank', 'det', 'inv', 'eig', 'null', 'multiplicity', 'lindep', 'add', 'sub', 'mult', 'div', 'diag', or 'exit').
5. **View Results:** Check the results of the selected operation and repeat steps 4-5 for different operations if needed.
